          <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
          <p>
            Random Tools does not collect, store, or share any personal data or
            personally identifiable information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tool preferences and settings are processed and stored locally on your
            device. This data never leaves your device.
          </p>

          <h2>Permissions</h2>
          <p>
            The app does not require sensitive permissions such as camera,
            microphone, or location to function.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            Random Tools is built using React Native and Expo. While the app itself
            does not collect data, platform providers such as the Apple App Store or
            Google Play may process anonymous diagnostics under their own policies.
          </p>

          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Since no personal information is collected, the app is appropriate for all
            ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            This policy may be updated over time. Continued use of the app after an
            update means acceptance of the revised policy.
          </p>
